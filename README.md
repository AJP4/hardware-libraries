- [Footprints to make circuit boards in Eagle](https://github.com/spark/hardware-libraries/tree/master/Eagle)
- [3D models in Sketchup](https://github.com/spark/hardware-libraries/tree/master/CAD)

**Show us what you make on the [community forum!](https://community.particle.io)**

## Hardware Prototyping

[Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) is a great open-source software to document your hardware projects. Here's how to add Particle devices to your projects:

1. [Download the Fritzing library](https://rawgit.com/spark/hardware-libraries/master/Fritzing/Particle.fzpz)
2. In Fritzing, use File -> Open to import the library.
3. Create a new sketch and add parts from the Particle bin.

## PCB Footprints

PCB footprints for Eagle are provided as a reference and you may need to adjust them for your application.

If you would like to contribute a library with the PCB footprints for another software, like KiCad, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/spark/hardware-libraries/pulls)

See the documentation for more details on the recommended PCB foot prints.

* [Photon with headers](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/photon-datasheet/#recommended-pcb-land-pattern-photon-with-headers-)
* [Photon without headers](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/photon-datasheet/#recommended-pcb-land-pattern-photon-without-headers-)
